# Book Vibe Your Library Assistant

**This website is a comprehensive platform for book lovers to explore, organize, and manage reading lists.

## Overview

This website is designed as an all-in-one book discovery and reading management platform for avid readers. Users can explore a collection of books categorized by genre and ratings, view book details, and sort books by pages or ratings. The platform has a seamless browsing experience with a dedicated “Home” page showcasing books and categories, a detailed “Listed Books” page to view books added to read or wish lists, and a “View Details” page for an in-depth look at each book’s description, review, and publisher. Additionally, users can store books in a “Read” or “Wishlist” category locally, allowing them to curate their own virtual library of books they’ve read or wish to read. <br><br>

If a user attempts to access a non-existent page, an “Error Page” gracefully directs them back to the homepage. This website is thoughtfully designed with an intuitive interface, providing a smooth user experience for discovering and managing books.
